# DFS- Algorithm

Consider this scenario: There are city with names A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H<br>
This is the connection between the cities:<br>
A is connected to B<br>
A is connected to C<br>
B is connected to D<br>
B is connected to E<br>
C is connected to F<br>
C is connected to G<br>
E is connected to H<br>
